Refactoring List 
A list of all of the things that I want to fix. (Actively Added to. Cleaned every Monday). 

TODO: 

0. Run tests for the Special Actions
1. Fix large if then else into a case statement. X
2. Move case into an abstract factory
3. Refactor with meaning.
4. Add human behavoir. Generalizing behavoir in player.     
5. Factor out the check for get color in the Robot class. 
6. Possibly create a map for the Card class that implements an enum that knows what to do with a match. IE Color can do ___ and Wild can be placed __ and special can ___
7. Each card should know its match and therefore can be moved into a single place. Possibly a check(c) function that allows the card to see what it is and what to do with it. The Deck could still implement the check but the card would be doing the validation.     
8. Should check to see if the card is being removed from the hand. If not implement a Remove(Card c) function at the player level.
