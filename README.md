A simple UNO game that is command line based. As it stands right now, the code will only work from the command line with two robots playing the UNO game. I will then aadd a UI that will allow for the robots to play against a human. It is my hope to then move the completed game into a graphical environment. 

A simple note on the author: I am not a Java programmer by trade. I did take a class in the language many moons ago but I am not fluent. I do have more experience with C++ than Java and that has lead my development with the system. I used the Netbeans IDE to configure and refactor most of the code to be as efficent as possible. This was a great learning experience about inheritance and run time reflection. I will do my best to make this code the best possible but I cannot claim to how strong the program actually is. The point of this program was not to make a game, but to learn Java principals and implement as much as possible. 

I do not own UNO as it is the property of the owner. This is only a academic endevor and I make no claims to it adhereance to the rules of the game or to the game itself. I will not monetize the game in any way. The use of this game was only to furhter my knowledge of Java.
